While Java is very useful and easy to apply to multi-platform projects, what it makes up for with
easier development it lacks in performance in comparison to languages like C++ and the such. When I 
looked at other frameworks we could use instead, React Native and Flutter caught my eye. One, because
both were cross-platform and focused on making the app development process easier, and because both are
being marketed as performance friendly. Flutter in particular catches my eye. Once every one of us finish
our training and start to understand and become confident in our code, I think we would be excited to pursue
working with Flutter and React.
