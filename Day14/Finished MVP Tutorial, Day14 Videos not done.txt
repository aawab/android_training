Title

Fixed MVP tutorial project issues. Searched up a solution and I was able to find one. Simply had to specify a
kotlinVersion in the build.gradle file, though there were still some mismatched version issues. Still ran
the program just fine.

Day14 Videos still not finished, will be done tomorrow.
